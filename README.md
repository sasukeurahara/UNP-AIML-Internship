## 📁 Projects

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction 📉

**Objective**: Predict which customers are likely to unsubscribe from a telecom service using various classification models.

**Dataset**: Customer usage data from an Iranian telecom company (12-month period, 3150 entries).

**Techniques Used**:
- Data preprocessing and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Outlier analysis and scaling with `StandardScaler`
- Implemented models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine

**Key Outcome**:
- **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the best performance with **95.36% accuracy** using a 75-25 train-test split.
- Identified key customer features influencing churn like age group, subscription length, and charge amount.

### 2. Regression Analysis Project 📊

**Objective**: Build and evaluate regression models to understand relationships between numeric variables and predict a continuous target value.

**Key Steps**:
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Trained and compared multiple regression algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

**Insight**: Random Forest Regressor consistently outperformed others in capturing non-linear relationships and reducing prediction error.
